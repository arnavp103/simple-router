## Sections Focused On

Arnav: ICMP Protocol Handling and Setup

Lance: ARP and IP Forwarding

Both of us swapped regularly to debug each otherâ€™s work.

## Implementing the required functionality

We will proceed with a high level overview of the problems faced and our solution.

### Core Router Functions

We needed to handle the response differently based on the type of the packet. Here we switched on protocol and handled both cases seperately.

Packet Handling (sr_router.c)

-   sr_handlepacket() - Main entry point for packet processing. Dispatches packets based on type (ARP vs IP).
-   sr_handle_arp() - Handles incoming ARP requests/replies. Sends ARP replies for requests targeting router interfaces.
-   sr_handle_ip() - Processes IP packets. Handles TTL expiry, ICMP messages, and packet forwarding.

### ARP Cache Management (sr_arpcache.c)

Here we simply proceeded with the pseudocode that was laid out in the comments of the header file.
Since we wanted to prevent the router from stalling while doing ARP requests, we tried to keep the code short and hold onto the lock for a minimal amount of time.

-   sr_arpcache_sweepreqs() - Periodically checks pending ARP requests and handles timeouts
-   sr_arpcache_handle_req() - Manages ARP request retries and timeouts (max 5 attempts)
-   sr_arpcache_insert() - Adds IP->MAC mappings to cache with 15 second timeout
-   sr_arpcache_queuereq() - Queues packets waiting for ARP replies

### ICMP Message Generation (sr_utils.c)

From the sr_protocol file we set up functionality to:
Responds to echo requests (ping)
Generates unreachable messages for:
Host unreachable (failed ARP)
Port unreachable (TCP/UDP to router)
Network unreachable (no route)
Handle TTL expired messages for traceroute

-   sr_send_icmp() - Sends ICMP error messages (unreachable, TTL expired, etc)
-   sr_send_icmp_ping() - Handles ICMP echo requests/replies specifically

We had to study the RFC for ICMP to determine that there's a difference in memory layout for ICMP ping which tripped us up but apart from some straightforward memory copying this wasn't too hard to implement.

### IP Forwarding

Here we use the longest prefix match to find the next hop. We then forward packets after ARP resolution.

-   sr_forward_ip() - Implements IP packet forwarding using longest prefix match routing as per CIDR with subnets.

Relatively straightforward since we can rely on the machinery of the ARP handling code we had before. There were some decisions we had to make with respect to handling non direct addresses so we based our solution to the piazza post about non contiguous subnets.
